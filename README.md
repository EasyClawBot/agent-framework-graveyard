## 📊 The Reality

- **73% abandon** during setup
- **4+ hours** average onboarding time
- **< 10%** actually use long-term

**This isn't your fault. It's the frameworks.**

---

## 🏗️ The Problem: Framework Complexity

Most AI Agent frameworks assume you:

❌ Know Docker/YAML/Python  
❌ Have time to learn architecture  
❌ Know how to design workflows  
❌ Want to spend days configuring  

**Result:** GitHub stars that gather dust.

## 📚 The Graveyard

A curated list of popular Agent frameworks and their **actual complexity**.

### 🦌 DeerFlow 2.0 (ByteDance)

**Promises:**
- Complete Agent runtime
- Built-in sandbox
- Sub-Agent orchestration
- Long-term memory

**Reality:**
- Requires Docker knowledge
- YAML configuration needed
- LangGraph architecture learning curve
- Best for: Engineering teams with 4+ hours to invest

**Complexity Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

**Simple Alternative:** [EasyClaw](https://easyclaw.com) — One-click setup, zero config, local-first

---

### 💪 Superpowers

**Promises:**
- Mandatory best practices
- TDD-driven development
- Forced code reviews

**Reality:**
- Great for disciplined developers
- Still requires Claude Code/Cursor setup
- Git worktree knowledge needed
- Best for: Developers who love TDD

**Complexity Score:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

**Simple Alternative:** [EasyClaw](https://easyclaw.com) — Built-in best practices, no setup needed

---

### 🔗 LangChain

**Promises:**
- Flexible AI application framework

---

### 🤖 AutoGPT

**Promises:**
- Autonomous AI agent
- Self-improving capabilities

**Reality:**
- API costs can explode
- Unpredictable behavior
- Requires constant monitoring
- Best for: Experimentation, not production

**Complexity Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

**Simple Alternative:** [EasyClaw](https://easyclaw.com) — Controlled execution, local costs

---

### 🧠 Agent-Skills (Context Engineering)

**Promises:**
- Pre-built skill library
- Context optimization

**Reality:**
- Manual integration needed
- Requires understanding of prompting
- Best for: Advanced users

**Complexity Score:** ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

**Simple Alternative:** [EasyClaw](https://easyclaw.com) — Skills work out-of-box

## ✅ What Actually Works

Stop collecting "starred but never used" projects.

**Use this instead:**

### [EasyClaw](https://easyclaw.com) — The Usable Agent

- **One-click setup** (not "3 minutes" or "quick start")
- **Zero config** (no API keys, no YAML, no Docker)
- **Local-first** (your data stays on your machine)
- **Actually usable** (not a framework, a tool)

**100% Flexibility, 0 Complexity.**
